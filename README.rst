################################################################################

A Forth_ system implemented in `Yeti's Simple Language`_. It's based on
the `Forth 2012 standard`_, but it doesn't adhere to it in some places so if you
want to use it make sure to check out the glossary_.

-------
 Usage
-------

To use YSL Forth:

1. Install YSL_, its host language;
2. Call ``ysl core.ysl`` in command line;
3. You should be greeted with the magic number 2137. You can now write Forth!


----------------------
 State of the project
----------------------

Currently there are two files: ``core.ysl`` and ``kernel.fs``. The first one is
the main YSL program that sets up the Forth environment and interpreter and then
reads and interprets the second one to declare more complex and higher-level
words. It's efficient to put a word definition in ``core.ysl``, but it's more
convenient to put them in ``kernel.fs``. At the moment ``core.ysl`` is capable
of interpreting the basic defintion words including ``:`` and ``code``,
so ``kernel.fs`` can contain ``code`` words with YSL bodies.

Many words are already implemented, including stack shuffling, control flow and
parsing/defining, but some areas (notably maths) are still lacking.

 How to contribute
-------------------

**PLEASE** fix any spelling, stylistic or grammar mistakes you find in the docs
(which for now includes just this ``README.rst``). I will accept any and all doc
fixing pull requests with minor scrutiny.

If you want something or implemented open an issue so we can talk about it and
then make a pull request resolving it. You can also find me
on `Esolangs Discord`_, I'm ``olus2000#5728``.
